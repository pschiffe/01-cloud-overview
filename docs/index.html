# Basic principles of Cloud applications and their architectural styles

# Do I hear Cloud again?

???

No clear specification what cloud means, but there is a plenty
of requirements for cloud applications.

---

# Brief history of cloud computing

* 2006 - Amazon Web Services
* 2007 - Heroku (PaaS)
* 2010 - Microsoft Azure
* 2010 - OpenStack (IaaS)
* 2011 - OpenShift (PaaS)
* 2011 - Google Cloud Platform

## In general

* When single server stops being enough
* with increasing demand for faster deployment
* with increasing demand for cheaper services
* with increasing number of technologies

---

# When single server is not enough

* More data
* Complex operations

--

### Vertical scaling is limited

* Faster CPU
* More RAM
* Bigger disk

### Horizontal scaling is not

* Add server

---

# Vertical scaling

### +

* Trivial architecture
* Simple to implement

### -

* Expensive
* Hardware failure cause bigger outages
* Limited

---

# Horizontal scaling

### +

* Theoretically unlimited
* Cheaper
* Easier fault-tolerance
* Easy upgrades

### -

* Complex architecture
* Harder to implement
* Bigger footprint

---

# Faster deployment

Better integrated management tools enable easier and more effective deployment of cloud infrastructure.

> Deploying new applications used to take the bank 8â€“12 weeks. Now it's done in just a few hours. New applications are delivered faster, with better quality, improving service for internal and external customers. [*]

---

## Before (hours to days)

* User creates IT ticket requesting new virtual server
* Admin creates and configures new machine
* User receives login information

## Now (minutes)

* User logs in to the self-service portal
* Selects virtual server template
* Creates new machine in couple of mouse clicks
* Once the virtual server boots, it's ready to use

---

# Cheaper services

Usually:
* no upfront costs
* no termination fees
* pay-as-you-go
  * unit of resource per hour

### Google Compute Engine example

* $0.033174 / vCPU hour
* $0.004446 / GB hour

---

# XaaS

Everything as a service:
* HaaS - Hardware as a Service
* IaaS - Infrastructure as a Service
* PaaS - Platform as a Service
* SaaS - Software as a Service
* ...

---

# Infrastructure as a Service

* Virtual Machines
* Networking
* Storage

### Ability to

* Use custom / to modify Operating System

---

## Networking

* SDN - Software defined networking
* Custom networks, subnets
* Custom firewall rules
* Custom DNS
* Load Balancing


* OpenvSwitch
* OpenDaylight

---

## Storage

Block storage:
* Block device (disk)
* Needs to be attached to the virtual server
* Easy to use, well supported

Object Storage:
* Cloud native storage
* Every object has ID - URI
* REST API - HTTP GET, PUT


* Amazon S3

---

## Storage II

Shared / Distributed Filesystem
* Cloud native
* Spans across multiple devices / servers
* Enables concurrent writes


* GlusterFS (distributed fs)
* Ceph (block &amp; object storage, distributed fs)

---

# IaaS (OpenStack)

![IaaS](img/iaas.png)

---

# Platform as a Service

* Application platform
* Languages, libraries, frameworks

### Ability to

* Deploy custom application

### Not possible to

* Manage OS

---

# PaaS (OpenShift)

![PaaS](img/paas.svg)

---

# Software as a Service

* Access to specific software

### Ability to

* Immediately use application

### Not possible to

* Change application

---

# Saas (CD as a Service)

![SaaS](img/saas.png)

---

# Classification of cloud types

* Public cloud
* Private cloud
  * Dedicated Cloud
* Hybrid cloud

---

# Public cloud

* Publicly available, shared with others
* Cost effective, ready to use


* Amazon Web Services
* Google Cloud Platform
* Microsoft Azure

---

# Private cloud

* On premise, usually for internal use
* Might be partially available to public
* Exclusively used by owner
* More expensive, requires set up period


* OpenStack
* CloudStack
* Eucalyptus
* OpenShift
* Mesos

---

# Dedicated cloud

* Managed by provider, for single customer


* OpenStack
* OpenShift

---

# Hybrid cloud

* Integrated cloud service utilizing both private and public clouds


* CloudForms
